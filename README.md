## Overview

Developed with Java and JavaFX, 'aMAZEing' leverages a customized Kruskal's algorithm to craft complex mazes. Players are immersed in a dungeon-themed adventure, navigating through a series of intricate paths and dead-ends.

## Technology Stack

- **Java**: The backbone of our game logic, both front-end and back-end.
- **JavaFX**: Empowers the creation of a visually rich game environment.
- **GitHub**: Facilitated our collaborative workflow, complemented by VScode's live share feature.

## Features

- Advanced maze generation for a highly challenging experience.
- Immersive dungeon setting with compelling visuals.
- Dynamic character movement coupled with screen scrolling for maze exploration.

## Learning Outcomes

Our hackathon journey enriched us with:

- Practical application of complex maze generation algorithms.
- Advanced Back-end and Front-end development experience.
- Improved UI design understanding through JavaFX.
- Turn ideas into tangible actions with collaborative efforts.
